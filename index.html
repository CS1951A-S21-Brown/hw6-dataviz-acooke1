                WRITTEN QUESTIONS:<br>
                1. My first graph shows the top 10 games by Global Sales base on the entered year. If no valid year is entered, 
                the dataset uses data over all time. In my pie chart, it is easy to see the top genres based on each region. You 
                can use the dropdown menu to select a specific region and the pie chart will show you the rankings of the genre 
                in that region. Hover over a section to see the percentage. My third graph is also very simple. It shows the top 
                publishers based on a given genre. Similar to my first bar chart, just select a genre from the drop down menu and 
                the chart will adjust accordingly to show rankings of publishers by global sales in that genre. <br>
                2. <br>
                    - d3 makes it easy to style the graphs and create transitions between different data<br>
                    - d3 makes it easy to use different types of graphs since we are able to use many built in functions<br>
                    - It was easy to have d3 interact with the front end<br>
                3. <br>
                    - Though d3 has plenty of options, it mainly covers graphs and using other visuals may have been useful<br>
                    - d3 may not be suited for all different browsers and might have some accessibility issues<br>
                    - d3 may not allow for data to be easily concealed<br>
                4. I think that my color scheme could have been improved. The readings talk a lot about accessibility for 
                users with vision impairments. My color scheme was not something which I had anticipated, and using more 
                contrasting colors would have been good. Other ways to accomodate for these accessibility features could have 
                involved the addition of audio cues. Adding a field to change text size could have also been useful. In order 
                to make my dashboard more accessibile, I would first try to learn more in depth how to use d3 and the styling
                functions. Then I would use this knowledge in order to add the features which I discuessed above as well as any
                others which I discover along the way.<br>
                5. Part of this was due to my lack of awareness before starting. I should have been more thourough in the readings 
                and the learning of d3. There are also other features or apps which I am sure could have helped improve accessibility,
                such as adding sound or helping locate accessibility issues which I could have researched on my own time.<br>
